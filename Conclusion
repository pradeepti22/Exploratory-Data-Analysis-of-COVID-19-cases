Developed countries have experienced the highest number of cases.
Countries with a good healthcare index are worst hit, but are trying to flatten the curve with strict lockdowns and social distancing measures.
Age is a great contributing factor. People of 34 years and older are at a higher risk. Pre-existing medical conditions can cause more complications.
Population density, surprisingly has not been a contributor for the widespread cases. Countries like US, Italy, Spain with very less Population density are the worst hit.
Coastal countries have recorded more cases than non-coastal ones.
Governments should not re-open the states/countries soon as there could be a chance of a second wave of infections. 
We can learn from some countries on how to implement strict lockdown guidelines, so that we achieve good recovery rate and reduce the burden on healthcare system.
